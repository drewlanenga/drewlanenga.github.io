There are times when putting reusable code in your own [personal R package](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) is useful &mdash; saving yourself time by structuring repetitive tooling, sharing difficult or specific implementations of hard problems to help others hate life less, etc.

This is kind of just a one off &mdash; and doesn't fit in either of those two categories &mdash; but I thought I'd share it here, since I'll probably eventually come back to it and I think it could be useful for others.

Sometimes you just want to load bash scripts in R &mdash; in my particular current case, mainly just to load environment variables from my `.bash_profile` &mdash; like for cron, running scripts in a cluster, etc.  But I don't want to pass them as arguments to some script, and it doesn't seem like [runr](https://github.com/yihui/runr) is doing what I want (yet).

So this is a snippet that will load environment variables.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/drewlanenga/22965c57f560ff85c589.js"></script>

It'd be nice if it would load other nice `bash`-y things, like functions, aliases, etc., and somehow made them available in the current session, but that might also be unnecessary.  (That is, I haven't yet found it necessary...)
